## Features
- Will be Optimized to handle large files
- Distributed data storage
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Efficient data retrieval
- Scalable architecture

## Requirement
- GO 1.23(used to develop this), should work with 1.16+

## Project Status
**Phase**: Still in development

Thinking to make it encryption cautious - still boggling over the use case to optimize it over.
Reading different papers till I find that one case.
